# Day 07
For the last 6 days it has been a rigorous learning phase. We almost covered the whole of HTML, CSS nad JS in jst 6 days. We compiled and provided you with top notch resources. Now its time to reap what we have sowed.

As mentioned earlier we have no learning resources for you on this last day. Rather this day will be completely devoted to making a project. We have not handicapped with you any project idea of our own. Rather you have to make a project of your own choice which will reflect your talent, creativity and innovations. Yes but one condition is that you have to build the projects using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Here are some of the project ideas which you can start working on:-

   - [Top 10 Projects For Beginners To Practice HTML and CSS Skills](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/) 
   - [10 Best Web Development Project Ideas For Beginners in 2021](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/10-best-web-development-project-ideas-for-beginners-in-2021/) 

After building a particular website it is important to deploy the website properly. We have already made a video demoying how to deploy a website successfully. You can refer to it if you want. Below you can find the link attached to that.

All the details regarding how to submit your project has been mentioned in the Project Format file the link to which is given below:-

   - [How to submit your project](https://github.com/hackclubiter/Codathon-WebDev/blob/main/projectformat.md)

The best project will be sent to the Hack Club HQ and if they find it interesting then they'll help you develop it further under the guidance mentors and also launch the project. 

But even if your project is not adjudged to be the best, if it is unique, then it will get featured in the Hack Club ITER's project section üëç

Now it has been a great journey with you guys for the last 7 days. Hope we will continue this further ... üíõüëã
